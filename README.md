# User-based_ML
This repository introduces a platform to perform a user-based regression task. The example data used in this notebook is the car_data.csv and is stored in a SQLite database system. The notebook is designed to tackle any data in general as long as the ultimate goal is to perform a regression. The user selects their desired set of features and output for this task. Then, the notebook cleans the data and modifies it based on their selected columns accordingly. They will be provided with some preprocessing steps such as a visualization of categorical and numerical features using bar and boxplots, respectively, as well as an illustration of the entire correlation matrix to help them with feature engineering. Finally, 5 different regression algorithms are trained and tested on the data, and their performances are compared to each other by showing their relevant metrics (root mean squared error and R2 score).
